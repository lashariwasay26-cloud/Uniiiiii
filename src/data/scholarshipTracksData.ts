Founded in 1861 in response to the rapid industrialization of the United States, MIT has consistently driven technological progress, scientific discovery, and societal innovation for over a century and a half. Today, MIT stands at the absolute pinnacle of global higher education, ranked #1 worldwide in the QS World University Rankings. MIT is renowned for its unyielding focus on science, technology, engineering, mathematics, artificial intelligence, computer science, economics, architecture, and management. Its educational philosophy rests firmly on the motto \"Mens et Manus\" (Mind and Hand), bridging rigorous mathematical and scientific theory with hands-on technical creation, prototyping, and real-world problem solving.\n\nAt the undergraduate level, MIT provides an immersive, intense, and collaborative learning environment. Rather than applying to a specific department or professional track, students are admitted to the Institute as a whole. Undergraduates spend their first year exploring fundamental scientific principles across physics, chemistry, biology, calculus, and humanities before declaring a major. MIT’s signature Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) enables over 90% of undergraduates to conduct genuine research alongside world-leading scientists and engineers in cutting-edge laboratories. From developing quantum computing algorithms and designing next-generation spacecraft to advancing cancer therapeutics and renewable energy grids, MIT undergraduates contribute directly to major scientific breakthroughs.\n\nMIT’s physical campus stretches along the Charles River, offering a vibrant culture characterized by intellectual curiosity, creative hacking, collaborative teamwork, and entrepreneurial drive. Located in the heart of Kendall Square—often called \"the most innovative square mile on the planet\"—MIT students are embedded within a thriving hub of biotechnology firms, AI labs, robotics startups, and venture capital firms. MIT’s admissions process is highly rigorous and holistic, seeking students who demonstrate academic mastery, passion for problem-solving, resilience, and collaborative spirit. Standardized testing is required for all first-year applicants, with median enrolled SAT scores spanning from 1510 to 1580. Crucially, MIT practices 100% need-blind admissions for all international and domestic applicants, meeting 100% of demonstrated financial need with zero merit or athletic requirements. Families with annual incomes under $200,000 attend tuition-free under MIT’s landmark affordability guidelines, ensuring that financial barriers never stand in the way of the world’s brightest mathematical and scientific minds.",

Yale College, the undergraduate liberal arts heart of the university, provides an exceptionally rich academic environment where students pursue concentrations across humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, computer science, mathematics, economics, political science, and psychology.\n\nA defining cornerstone of undergraduate life at Yale is its famous residential college system. Every undergraduate is assigned to one of 14 residential colleges, creating intimate, supportive micro-communities complete with living quarters, dining halls, libraries, art studios, and faculty mentorship. Academic flexibility is paramount at Yale: undergraduates are encouraged to explore widely across disciplines without rigid professional siloing, fostering deep analytical thinking, creative synthesis, and lifelong intellectual curiosity. Yale boasts top-ranked departments across political science, economics, history, law preparation, medicine, biological sciences, and computer science.\n\nIn admissions, Yale maintains a 100% need-blind policy for all international applicants worldwide, ensuring that ability to pay never impacts an admission decision regardless of citizenship. Yale meets 100% of demonstrated financial need for every admitted undergraduate with zero required student loans. Under Yale’s expanded affordability threshold, qualifying families earning under $100,000 pay $0 total cost (covering tuition, housing, food, and personal expenses), while families earning under $200,000 receive aid covering at least full tuition. Standardized testing (SAT/ACT) is required under Yale’s test-flexible policy, with median enrolled SAT scores spanning 1500 to 1580.",
