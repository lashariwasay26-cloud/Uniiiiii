      fullText: `PUNCTUATION CHOICES THAT LOOK SIMILAR:
Choices: A) ,  B) ;  C) :  D) —
Do NOT compare them based on appearance. Classify structure first.

THE "STRIP THE EXTRAS" TECHNIQUE:
Long SAT sentences often contain information designed to distract you.
Example: "The researchers from three universities, after conducting several years of collaborative studies in remote regions, discovered a previously undocumented species."
Strip away extra material: "The researchers discovered a species."

THE "CORE SENTENCE" TEST:
"The collection of rare manuscripts from several European libraries was transferred to the university."
Nearest noun = libraries (plural). Subject = collection (singular). Verb = was (singular).
Core: "The collection was transferred."

CONCEPT 22 & 23 — GRAMMAR VS. MEANING:
Filter 1 = Grammar. Filter 2 = Meaning & Logic. Never stop after Filter 1 if multiple choices survive.

ADVANCED ELIMINATION SYSTEM (5 FILTERS):
FILTER 1 — STRUCTURE: What is on each side?
FILTER 2 — HARD GRAMMATICAL ELIMINATION: Remove comma splices, run-ons, fragments.
FILTER 3 — RELATIONSHIP: Addition, contrast, cause, result, condition, time, explanation?
FILTER 4 — PRECISION: Which choice communicates the relationship most precisely?
FILTER 5 — WHOLE-SENTENCE CHECK: Read entire sentence to confirm complete correctness.`,
      rules: [
        'Filter 1: Structure -> Filter 2: Hard Grammar -> Filter 3: Relationship -> Filter 4: Precision -> Filter 5: Whole Sentence.',

        { label: 'EXAMPLE 1: STRIP THE EXTRAS', sentence: 'The researchers from three universities, after conducting several years of collaborative studies in remote regions, discovered a previously undocumented species.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Stripping the prepositional and participial modifiers reveals the core sentence: "The researchers discovered a species."' },
        { label: 'EXAMPLE 2: CORE SENTENCE TEST', sentence: 'The collection of rare manuscripts from several European libraries was transferred to the university.', isCorrect: true, explanation: 'Subject = "collection" (singular), verb = "was transferred" (singular).

Whenever punctuation is tested, ask three questions in order:
QUESTION 1: "What is immediately before the blank?"
QUESTION 2: "What is immediately after the blank?"
QUESTION 3: "What relationship should the punctuation create?"

DEPENDENT CLAUSE + DEPENDENT CLAUSE:
"Although the experiment was successful, because the equipment was available, the researchers decided to repeat it."
Break it into units: [D], [D], I.

RELATIVE CLAUSES AND SENTENCE BOUNDARIES:
Relative clauses begin with who, which, that, whose, whom.
Example: "The telescope that the researchers repaired is now operational."
Core sentence: "The telescope is now operational."

"THAT" DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN A COMMA:
"The device that the engineers designed was unusually efficient." (No comma).
Compare: "The device, which the engineers designed last year, was unusually efficient." (Commas required).

RELATIVE CLAUSE AS A HIDDEN DISTRACTION:
"The collection of artifacts that the museum acquired last year ___ contains several rare objects."
Core structure: "The collection contains several rare objects."`,

Prepositional phrases contain nouns that look like subjects.
Example: "The group of researchers from several universities completed the study."
Subject = group (not researchers). Core = "The group completed the study."

PARTICIPIAL PHRASES:
Participial phrases begin with forms ending in -ing, -ed, -en.
Example: "Working late into the evening, the researchers completed the report."

INFINITIVE PHRASES:
Infinitive phrases begin with to + base verb.
Example: "To determine the cause of the failure, the engineers examined the equipment."

APPOSITIVE PHRASES:
An appositive renames or identifies a nearby noun.
Example: "The expedition's leader, Dr. Malik, presented the findings."
