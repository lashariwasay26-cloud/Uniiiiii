    exerciseTitle: 'Geometric Formula Inversion with Radicals',
    question: 'The formula for the volume of a cone with a radius of r and height of h is V = (1/3)π·r²·h. What is the expression for the radius of a cone in terms of the volume of the cone?',

    correctIndex: 1,
    correctAnswerText: '√((3V) / (πh))',
    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Start with the given volume formula:
   V = (1/3)π · r² · h.
2. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   3V = π · r² · h.
3. Divide both sides by πh to isolate r²:
   r² = (3V) / (πh).
4. Take the positive square root of both sides (since geometric radius r > 0):
   r = √((3V) / (πh)).

Desmos Shortcut:
Assign test numbers: V = 100, h = 5.
r² = (3 · 100) / (5π) = 60 / π ≈ 19.0986 → r = √(19.0986) ≈ 4.370.

1. Start with the luminosity equation:
   L = 4π · d² · b.
2. Isolate d² by dividing both sides by 4πb:
   d² = L / (4πb).

    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Examine the y-intercept at x = 0:
   f(0) = 1.
   Any non-zero base raised to power 0 equals 1: b⁰ = 1.
2. Examine the base ratio between successive x-values:
   f(1) / f(0) = 10 / 1 = 10.
   f(0) / f(-1) = 1 / (1/10) = 10.
3. The common multiplier (base) is b = 10.

    question: 'The gravitational force equation is F = (G · M_E · m) / d². For two satellites of the same mass in Earth\'s orbit, the force of Earth\'s gravity on Object A is 9 times the force of Earth\'s gravity on Object B.

    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    correctAnswerText: '1/3',
    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Since G, M_E, and m are constants, F is inversely proportional to d²:
   F ∝ 1 / d², meaning d² ∝ 1 / F, so d ∝ 1 / √F.
2. We are given: F_A = 9 · F_B.
3. Express the ratio of distances:
   d_A / d_B = √(F_B / F_A) = √(F_B / (9 F_B)) = √(1/9) = 1/3.
4. Thus, d_A = (1/3) · d_B.

Desmos Shortcut:
Let F_B = 1, so F_A = 9.
d_B = 1/√1 = 1, d_A = 1/√9 = 1/3.
The ratio d_A / d_B = (1/3) / 1 = 1/3.`,

1. Substitute b = 4 into the equation:
   √(a + 1) = 4.
2. Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
   (√(a + 1))² = 4²
   a + 1 = 16.
3. Subtract 1 from both sides:
   a = 16 - 1 = 15.

    correctIndex: 0,
    correctAnswerText: 'The amount of carbon in the sample halves 24 times every minute.',
    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Look at the base and exponent of the model:
   • The base is 1/2, representing a halving (50% reduction) event.
   • The exponent is 24m, where m is time in minutes.
2. When m increases by 1 minute:
   • The exponent increases by 24 · 1 = 24.
   • This means the factor of 1/2 is multiplied 24 times in that single minute.
3. Therefore, the quantity halves 24 times every minute (or once every 60/24 = 2.5 seconds).

Desmos Shortcut:
Evaluate C(0) = 100 and C(1) = 100 · (1/2)²⁴ = 100 · (0.5)²⁴.

    correctAnswerText: '2√a',
    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Simplify the given equation:
   a = (4a²) / 16 = a² / 4.
2. Multiply both sides by 4:
   4a = a².
3. Since a is a nonzero integer, divide both sides by a:
   a = 4.
4. Now test the options with a = 4:
   • Option A: 4a = 4(4) = 16 ≠ 4
   • Option B: 2√a = 2√4 = 2(2) = 4 (Exact Match: 2√a = a)

    correctAnswerText: 'N(t) = 100(0.5)^(t / 5730)',
    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. General exponential decay model: N(t) = Initial · (Decay Factor)^(t / Period).
2. Initial quantity = 100 grams.
3. Half-life decay factor = 0.5 (or 1/2).
4. Period required for one half-life = 5,730 years.

    correctIndex: 1,
    correctAnswerText: 'P = V² / R',
    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. From Ohm's Law (IR = V), solve for current I:
   I = V / R.
2. Substitute I = V / R into the power radical equation:
   V / R = √(P / R).
3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
   (V / R)² = (√(P / R))²
   V² / R² = P / R.
4. Multiply both sides by R to isolate P:
   P = (V² · R) / R² = V² / R.

Let V = 12, R = 4.
I = 12 / 4 = 3.

    question: 'A student\'s score on a standardized test is projected to increase by a% for every 4 practice tests the student takes. The function S(p) = 1200(1.2)^((1/4)p) represents this situation, where p is the number of practice tests taken. What is the value of a?',

    correctAnswerText: '20',
    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. The problem asks for the percentage increase for every 4 practice tests (p = 4).
2. Substitute p = 4 into the exponential function:
   S(4) = 1200 · (1.2)^((1/4) · 4) = 1200 · (1.2)¹ = 1200(1.2).
3. Express the growth multiplier (1.2) as a percentage increase:
   Multiplier = 1 + r = 1.20 → r = 0.20 = 20%.
4. Therefore, the score increases by 20%, so a = 20.

Desmos Shortcut:
Calculate S(0) = 1200 and S(4) = 1200(1.2)¹ = 1440.
Percent increase = (1440 - 1200) / 1200 = 240 / 1200 = 0.20 = 20%.`,

    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Start with the given formula:
   I = (PT) / √(1 + R).
2. Multiply both sides by √(1 + R) and divide by I:
   √(1 + R) = (PT) / I.
3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Note the units: x is time in seconds, but r% is the growth rate per minute.
2. In 1 minute, there are 60 seconds (x = 60).
3. Evaluate the multiplier after 1 minute (x = 60):
   (1.52)^(60/60) = (1.52)¹ = 1.52.
4. Relate the growth multiplier to the percentage increase r%:

    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Substitute k = 3 into the equation:
   √(x - 3) = x - 9.
2. Square both sides:
   x - 3 = (x - 9)²
   x - 3 = x² - 18x + 81.
3. Bring all terms to one side:
   x² - 19x + 84 = 0.
4. Factor the quadratic:
   (x - 12)(x - 7) = 0 → Potential solutions: x = 12, x = 7.
5. High-Frequency Trap Verification (MANDATORY Extraneous Check):
   • Test x = 12: LHS = √(12 - 3) = √9 = 3; RHS = 12 - 9 = 3. Since 3 = 3, x = 12 is a VALID solution.
   • Test x = 7: LHS = √(7 - 3) = √4 = 2; RHS = 7 - 9 = -2. Since 2 ≠ -2 (principal square root is non-negative), x = 7 is an EXTRANEOUS root!

    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Factor the numerator quadratic:
   q² - q - 42 = (q - 7)(q + 6).
2. Simplify the rational expression on the LHS for q ≠ -6:
   ((q - 7)(q + 6)) / (q + 6) = q - 7.
3. Set equal to the RHS radical:
   q - 7 = √(q - 5).
4. Square both sides:
   (q - 7)² = q - 5
   q² - 14q + 49 = q - 5
   q² - 15q + 54 = 0.

6. Test both solutions in the original un-squared radical equation (q - 7 = √(q - 5)):

    explanation: `Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Convert 75 minutes into hours:
   h = 75 / 60 = 5/4 hours = 1.25 hours.
2. Substitute h = 5/4 into the exponent (4/5)h:
   Exponent = (4/5) · (5/4) = 1.
3. Therefore, every 75 minutes, the amount is multiplied by:
